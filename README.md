# Insure landing page - Frontend Mentor

Front-end coding challenge proposed by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to.

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
